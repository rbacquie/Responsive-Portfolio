      <p>Hello, and welcome to my Profolio Page, where I will detail some information about myself and my experiences in the technology industry over the last couple years. </p>

      <p>I became involved within the computer industry as a young man and learned to assemble computers from scratch and conduct basic trouble shooting and repairs. Computers and there capabilities have always fascinated me with its vast versatility.</p>

      <p>Over the years I have learned to Build and trouble shoot Personal Computers, build several Crypto Currency Mining systems, learned Web Development which includes learning the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <il><strong> TECHNICAL SKILLS:</strong></il><br>
         <il>Node.Js</il>Express, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, React Native, GIT, Github, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Media Queries, APIs, JSON, REST, AJAX
          </il><br>
          <p>I am currently still on the quest to advance my current skill sets and learn others as I dwell further in this vast world with out limitations.<br> My goal is for one day to create a platform to bring ideas and people together removing common mental barriers ingrained over the years.</p>
          <p>Please take a minute to look at my projects and I hope you enjoy what you see.</p>
